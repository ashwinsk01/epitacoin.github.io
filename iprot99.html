            <p style="font-family:Georgia,sans-serif"> <b>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</b>:<br>

UDP (user datagram protocol) internet protocol was officially demarcated by David Reed in 1980 with the RFC 768 under internet standards. The creation of this protocol was revolutionary because it didn't require a connection for communication. UDP was connectionless and could send packets and communication between network endpoints without a prior arrangement.<br><br>

“UDP uses a simple connectionless communication model with a minimum of protocol mechanism. UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and port numbers for addressing different functions at the source and destination of the datagram. It has no handshaking dialogues, and thus exposes the user's program to any unreliability of the underlying network; there is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection.<br><br>

UDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction are either not necessary or are performed in the application; UDP avoids the overhead of such processing in the protocol stack. Time-sensitive applications often use UDP

because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for packets delayed due to retransmission, which may not be an option in a real-time system."[13]<br><br>

Applications that use this protocol have to be set to allow for loss, errors, and duplication. Otherwise, they will fail. Loss of packets in protocols like Voice over Internet Protocol, streaming media, 'Massive Multiplayer Online games' or real-time multiplayer games can withstand the loss of a few packets and still function appropriately.<br><br>

Thus, the industry standard for gaming has chosen to be UDP for their low latency. [5]<br><br><br>

<b>Transmission control protocol/ Internet protocol (TCP/IP)</b> <br>

During the late 1970's and into the 80's, the U.S. Department of Defense experienced numerous technical failures when attempting to connect multiple computers (nodes) and multiple networks with the intent of sharing data and information. In 1981, the government was successful following the implementation of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) technologies. in bringing the Internet alive with these combined (TCP/IP) technologies, project engineers and researchers were able to meet the needs of most users by enabling online capabilities to perform file transfers, e-mail, file sharing and remote log on functions.[14]<br><br>

TCP is The most popular network protocol in the world, it was designed in 1970s by 2 DARPA scientists—Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, persons most often called the fathers of the Internet.<br>

The way TCP works is that it it communicate with the application layer through and port , then it receives the data and chop them into small chunks called packets were

they individually take the quickest route over the internet to get to where they want to go.<br><br>

To make sure that the receiving computer can put the packets down together properly ,TCP puts a header on each packet that contain instruction on what order to reassemble the packets and a error checking information so that the receiving computer knows if he have received the packets without any errors.<br><br>

After that , the packets are pushed into the internet layer which uses the IP to attach both the origin (where the data came from) and the destination IP addresses so the packet knows where’s it’s going and where it came from , then the data is sent to the network layer so the packets can go to the right address.</p>
