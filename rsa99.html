  <p style="font-family:Georgia,sans-serif">RSA encryption, in full Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption, type of public-key cryptography widely used for data encryption of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet. RSA is named for its inventors, Ronald L. Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard M. Adleman, who created it while on the faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<br><br>

Up until the 1970s, cryptography had primarily been based on the use of symmetric keys **. In symmetric key algorithms, two users who wish to communicate a message with each other use the same cryptographic keys for both the encryption of the plaintext and decryption of the ciphertext. The keys represent a shared secret between the two parties and can be used as a private form of communication. However, there are some inherent problems with this design that leads to some serious drawbacks of its use. [16]<br><br>

A user of RSA creates and then publishes a public key based on two large prime numbers, along with an auxiliary value. The prime numbers must be kept secret. Anyone can use the public key to encrypt a message, but with currently published methods, and if the public key is large enough, only someone with knowledge of the prime numbers can decode the message feasibly.[2] Breaking RSA encryption is known as the RSA problem. Whether it is as difficult as the factoring problem remains an open question.<br><br>

RSA is a relatively slow algorithm, and because of this, it is less commonly used to directly encrypt user data. More often, RSA passes encrypted shared keys for symmetric key cryptography which in turn can perform bulk encryption-decryption operations at much higher speed.</p>
