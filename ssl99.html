		  <h1>Secure Socket Layers</h1>
		   <a href="links.html" alt="" target="_blank">Sources</a>
  <p style="font-family:Georgia,sans-serif">SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This link ensures that all data passed between the web server and browsers remain private and integral. SSL is an industry standard and is used by millions of websites in the protection of their online transactions with their customers.<br><br>

SSL certificate encryption is just a modern and much more advanced option in this transfer of secure information. There is actually a very interesting history in encryption technology and one that is worth taking a closer look at to understand how we arrived at our current levels of hacker-proof secure data transmission.<br><br>

      <u>Early decryption days</u><br><br>

It is assumed by archaeologists that the first real attempts to put information into a code or a cipher are found on clay tablets that are believed to date back to 1500 BCE. Interestingly enough, this may have also been the first trade secret as the message is thought to be the list of ingredients to create a specific pottery glaze, something that would have been critical back in that time.<br><br>

The most readily recognized ciphers, the Atbash ciphers, were first developed by Hebrew scholars between 500 and 600 BCE. These are the ciphers that include substituting one letter for another, traditionally reversing the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. In our alphabet, that would mean substituting the letter z for every letter "a" and so on.<br><br>

With the invention of the internet, in the early days, more people started using the internet, at that time the internet had been very accessible by anyone and the security measurements on the networking part were very tiny.<br><br>

Thus, The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Protocol was developed in 1994 by Netscape in response to the growing concern over security on the Internet.<br>

      <li>* Originally developed for securing communications between a Web server and Web browsers regardless of operating system.</li>

      <li>>* SSL works at the Transport and Session layers of the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model to support the Application layer.</li>

      <li>* The specification was designed to allow higher level protocols to use SSL.</li>

      <li>* FTP</li>

      <li>* HTTP</li>

      <li>* Telnet</li>

      <li>* Designed to take advantage of new encryption schemes.</li><br><br>

In November 1995, Netscape made the SSL 3.0 specification public. Which is the version Web servers use today and It is better than version 2.0 because: 1- It reduces the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack from occurring during the SSL handshake process.<br><br>

2- It supports additional cipher suites.<br>

A Web server running SSL provides: <br>
      <li>A) Privacy : Preventing eavesdropping.</li> 
      <li>B) Authentication: Preventing impersonation.</li> 
      <li>C) Integrity :Preventing modification</li>.<br><br>

* SSL uses different algorithms each with a different key to achieve all three. o Using private key encryption in the encryption sessions. o Using public key encryption for authentication of clients and servers. o Using private key encryption to encrypt the application data</p>
